## Development instructions

- Do not stop until an error occurs which you cannot resolve after extensively troubleshooting, a clarifying question is needed, or the task is complete.
- Always think through the user's query and understand their intent before taking action.
- When you need to ask a clarifying question, do so directly and wait for a response.
- Devise a clear plan of action to answer the question or complete the task.
- Always use context7 to get additional information when specific libraries are being used or if there are general best practices for the language or framework worth following
- Search the internet for relevant documentation, examples, and best practices as needed.
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code following best practices for the specific programming
- Never use emojis
- Do not create markdown files explaining what was complete unless explicitly instructed to do so
- Build an application following an eager test driven development (TDD) approach, writing tests before implementing features and then continuously running the tests to ensure functionality, as well as expanding test coverage throughout the development process and re-evaluating existing tests for relevance and accuracy.
- Reference `README.md` for project overview and setup instructions. Update it as necessary to reflect changes made during development.
